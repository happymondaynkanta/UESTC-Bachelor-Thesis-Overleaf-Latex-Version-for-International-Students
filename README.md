# UESTC-Bachelor-Thesis-Overleaf-Latex-Version-for-International-Students
This is the Overleaf Latex version of UESTC Bachelor Thesis for International Undergraduate students who wish to format their final year thesis using overleaf latex template rather than word template which comes with so much troubles. 

# Short brief 
UESTC Thesis in overleaf latex version for undergraduate International Students. UESTC Thesis Format for undergraduate International Students has always been in Word template which makes it difficult for final year undergraduate international students to meet the required format. In this repository, I have rewritten the Latex Format to suit the undergraduate international students.
